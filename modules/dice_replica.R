# DICE Damage function on level of economic productivity
# Uses DICE-2016R

# economic impact, damage coefficient = D/(1+D) #DICE 2016R
# T is the temperature of atmosphere increase (degrees C from 1900)
# calculates the damage fraction, D = 0.00236TË†2. Damage is a fraction of gross output in this damage function.

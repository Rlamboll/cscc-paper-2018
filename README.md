# Country-level Social Cost of Carbon

This is the source code of the program to generate 
the country-level social costs of 
carbon. 
It is based on the material provided with the paper 
K. Ricke, L. Drouet, K. Caldeira and M. Tavoni, 
*Country-level Social Cost of Carbon*,
**Nature Climate Change**.
DOI: 10.1038/s41558-018-0282-y.
Other materials are available at https://country-level-scc.github.io.

Modifications of this were made by R. Lamboll and L. Blocke, allowing more 
options to be made and more economic results to be analysed and plotted. 

The main script is `generate_cscc.R`

An example is provided by `country-level-social-cost-of-carbon.Rmd`
